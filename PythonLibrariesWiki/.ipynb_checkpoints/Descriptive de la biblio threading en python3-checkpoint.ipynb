    "The threading module builds on the low-level features of thread to make working with threads even easier and more pythonic. Using threads allows a program to run multiple operations concurrently in the same process space. \n",

    "A daemon thread will shut down immediately when the program exits. One way to think about these definitions is to consider the daemon thread a thread that runs in the background without worrying about shutting it down. \n",

    "Race Conditions: \n",
    "\n",
    "A race condition arises in software when a computer program, to operate properly, depends on the sequence or timing of the program's processes or threads. Critical race conditions cause invalid execution and software bugs. Critical race conditions often happen when the processes or threads depend on some shared state. Operations upon shared states are done in critical sections that must be mutually exclusive. Failure to obey this rule can corrupt the shared state. \n",

    "Multiprocessing in python : \n",
    "\n",
    "multiprocessing is a package that supports spawning processes using an API similar to the threading module. The multiprocessing package offers both local and remote concurrency, effectively side-stepping the Global Interpreter Lock by using subprocesses instead of threads. Due to this, the multiprocessing module allows the programmer to fully leverage multiple processors on a given machine. It runs on both Unix and Windows. "
